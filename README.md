# Sales & Customers Dashboard
## Overview

A dashboard was created using Tableau to showcase the performance of top products. Tableau was chosen to make data sharing easy and simple. The author of the dataset was Leanne Vermeulen, who generated the fictitious data used throughout this project.

### First Dashboard

The first page features general sales information, including KPIs, target metrics, bar charts, and high-level and detailed product breakdowns. KPIs for the number of sales, orders, customers, customers who've made a sale, and average days to shipment were added to clarify the performance of the product line for decision-makers. Dynamic bar charts for customers who've made a sale, and the proportion of sub-categories by sales have been included to support this further. Additionally, there are controls to change which data is being viewed: sales, quantity, or orders. At the bottom of the dashboard lies a high-level product overview, complemented by a detailed breakdown of individual products. Lastly, static sales targets for sub-categories have been established to state the business's objectives, which, when paired with the high-level overview, will guide decision-makers in investigating under-performing stock at the low-level details.

## Preparation of the Dashboard

Four CSV files were imported and joined together using primary and foreign keys from relevant tables: combined sales data, customers, products, and monthly sales targets.
